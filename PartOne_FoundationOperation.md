# Some foundation operation

This part stem from GitHub Guides, because I never met the kind of this platform to concept design, after reading some times, to collecting of a short file, so that read easily.
this part have three key words, as follow:
1. repository:It just like a file package, include many file and project other message.
2. brach:I think this way is used of concept design, by the way that merge the brach and master to uprage the project.
3. file:Record main project message.

Meanwhile will have a list of operation:
</br>The first: Creat repository
The second: Creat Brach
The third: Edit and commit
The forth: Compare the brach with master
The fifth: Merge the pull request
